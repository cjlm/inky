# Inky wHAT Weather Station

Inky wHAT eInk display from Pimoroni driven by a Raspberry Pi Zero (or any other Raspberry Pi) to display a seven day weather forecast.

The weather information is fetched from OpenWeather:

Here you need to create an account and an API key. Put the code into the "weather.py" file ("api_key" variable). You also need to set your location ("lat" and "lon" variables).

## Setup

The Pimoroni Inky wHAT display requires a bunch of software to be installed. My recommendation is to follow the description in a Pimoroni tutorial:

[Getting Started with Inky wHAT](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-inky-what)

The installation is done by executing a bash script, and it takes a while. Everything is installed for Python 2 and 3 which isn't necessary from my point of view, so you might consider deselecting version 2 in the script before running it.

We need to convert Erik's SVG icons to 8 bit PNGs. I'm using the Imagemagick "mogrify" command for the bulk convert. With Erik's original SVGs this would deliver PNGs with a 30 x 30 pixel resolution which is too small. Using the mogrify's "resize" option didn't work so I changed the SVGs to 95 x 95 pixels by using a "vim" script (see below). The original SVGs are stored in a 7z-file in the "icons" folder. In the setup script "setup.sh" there is a line to remove the modified SVGs after PNG conversion (commented out, security reasons ;-) ).

The main Python file to drive the display is "weather.py". My display is a "red" one. You may have to change the color in the Python file if you own a different one.

Here is what the setup script "setup.sh" does:

```
cd icons
7za x erik_flowers_weather-icons.7z
find -name "*.svg" -exec vim -s script.vim {} \;
mogrify -background white -format PNG8 *.svg
#rm *.svg
```
